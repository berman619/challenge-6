# Server-Side APIs Challenge: Weather Dashboard

## Description

As part of the Columbia Coding Boot Camp, I was tasked with creating a weather dashboard from scratch to apply the skills learned in our unit on server-side APIs. The assignment was to develop a weather dashboard with form inputs to search for a city that presents the user with current weather and a 5-day forecast. The application also uses local storage to display the search history, and when the user clicks on a previously searched city, that city's weather will be displayed. 

While completing this project, I referenced materials from the Columbia Coding Boot Camp, MDN Web Docs, and W3Schools.
